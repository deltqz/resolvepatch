Works with Resolve 20.02+ (kinda).
Still glitches during export, even when using external encoders.
The og dev will eventually work on a proper fix for that.

Get the exe from: https://github.com/deltqz/resolvepatch/releases
<br>Or download this repo and build it yourself with:
```sh
rustup install nightly
cargo +nightly build
```
If you installed Davinci Resolve on `C:\Program Files\`, you might need to run the exe as administrator because of how Windows handles permisions for things installed in there.
