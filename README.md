Patch Davinci Resolve Studio 18.x-20.x to think it's activated

**Some users are experiencing a rendering bug in versions >18.6.2. This is possibly an antipiracy measure. Resolve is incredibly annoying to analyze due to its size, and I am currently very busy, but I am planning to check this out further once I have the time. Either use 18.6.2 or render the output with padding to the top, then cut the padding back off with ffmpeg.**

## Instructions

- Go to the [Support Page](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/davinci-resolve-and-fusion) and find your desired version of Davinci Resolve **Studio**
- Install Davinci Resolve Studio
- Run the precompiled release **OR** [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and run `cargo run` in the project folder
- Done
